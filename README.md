# Countdown-Clock-and-Timer-in-Python
The code is a python program that can show the current time and create a countdown based on the user input. It uses the time module to manipulate and format time values, and defines two functions: show_time and countdown. It calls these functions before and after the countdown, and prints messages to the user.
